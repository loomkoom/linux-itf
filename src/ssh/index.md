# Remote access via SSH

When we perform work on a server in practice, we will rarely, if ever, have physical access to our server.
It may be located in a data room far away in a building or even on the other side of the world.
Since most companies use the cloud, there is little even known where this server is running.

In short, we need a secure way to configure and manage our servers. From the networking classes you probably already know Telnet and SSH. In the Linux world SSH is mostly used exclusively. SSH has gained popularity mainly because of the good security of the protocol. But it also offers useful functions such as: sending files, forwarding network traffic and more.

If you run a server in the cloud then you will usually get an SSH login to further set up the server.

## Setting up SSH

### Installation

::: warning note
Most Linux servers already have an SSH server installed. This is the case for our VMs. The following instructions are for your information, or if you want to use SSH on an Ubuntu Desktop.
:::

We inset our SSH server via `apt`

```bash
apt install ssh openssh-server # Install SSH via apt
systemctl status ssh # check the status of ssh
```

### SSH clients

Now that we have an SSH server we will also need an SSH client

#### Windows

In the past, [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) was the best option for SSH on Windows.
However, since recent versions of Windows 10, Microsoft has also built in an SSH client! You can green it with the `ssh` command in PowerShell or CMD.

However, we recommend the new [Microsoft Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701#activetab=pivot:overviewtab). This Terminal allows you (after 20 years finally) to use the different Windows command line interfaces together and to adapt them to your own preferences! And is therefore much more user friendly than PowerShell alone. You can even use it in combination with Git Bash to have a Bash shell on Windows, which will be very convenient for our purposes.

[Windows Terminal](./terminal.png)

#### macOS

macOS has an SSH client built in. You can use it by just opening the Terminal app.

#### Linux

First of all congratualations on your choice of desktop OS! Most Linux installations come with an SSH client by default. If you don't have this command available, you can download it from your package manager. The example below is for Ubuntu:

```bash
apt update
apt install ssh
```

### Connecting to your server

The SSH command has a simple structure:

```
ssh [options] [user@]hostname
```

First the word `ssh` followed by any options, we are hardly going to use these. Then comes the user name and hostname.

For example, we want to log on with the user `ubuntu` to the server `10.0.0.1`.

```bash
ssh ubuntu@10.0.0.1
```

We try this out with our own server. Immediately after this we get a question

```
The authenticity of host '10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:pc8xxMRaW8kmA/p+GUXoi1dR2CQBlGpUfIXT2Ypde0I.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

The first time you connect to a server you are asked if you trust this server.
We type `yes` followed by enter. This succeeds in capturing the fingerprint of our SSH server's key. This way we know for sure that the next time we connect we are talking to the same server!

::: warning note
If you reinstall your server or change the IP you may get the following message. If you are sure you have changed your server's SSH keys you may follow the remove instructions that will remove the fingerprint from your trust store.

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ED25519 key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:pc8xxMRaW8kmA/p+GUXoi1dR2CQBlGpUfIXT2Ypde0I.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/maartje/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ED25519 key in /home/maartje/.ssh/known_hosts:503
remove with:
ssh-keygen -f "/home/maartje/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "10.0.0.1"
ED25519 host key for 10.0.0.1 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
```

:::

Next, your server is going to ask for your password:

```
$ ssh ubuntu@10.0.0.1
ubuntu@10.0.0.1's password:

```

Enter this. Note that SSH cares about your security and doesn't even show asterisks for the password, so if you don't see anything it's normal! Then press enter and you are now connected to the server! After this you can work as usual on a Linux machine! You can also copy-paste between the machines (very convenient, isn't it?).

### Security

SSH is an encrypted protocol, which ensures that all data including passwords is encrypted over the network. Access to our server is password protected. But is a password such a good idea?

We put an SSH server on the public Internet with password access for 5 minutes to demonstrate:

Botnets are constantly scanning for SSH servers to test out every possible password. Why are they likely to get in? [We'll look at this in the Password Security chapter](/security/passwords)

So how do we get an SSH server secure on the Internet? We're going to use [SSH Keys](/security/ssh-keys).

## The next generation: MOSH

[MOSH](https://mosh.org/) (mobile shell) is seen as a successor to SSH. MOSH mainly comes from the problem of SSH connections on connections which can break (read: 4G connection on the train, walking around between different AP points or very dynamic IP addresses). An SSH connection will also break if your IP changes.

Advantages of MOSH over SSH are:

- Does not run as privileged user
- Designed for UTF-8 character set
- Builds on SSH Security
- Uses UDP with its own packet-loss detection
- Can be resumed indefinitely
